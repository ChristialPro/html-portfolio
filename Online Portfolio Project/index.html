    <h2 class="name-header">Hi! I'm Christial</h2>

    <p>
      I started my career in the Public Health space when I received my
      Bachelors in Health Sciences from New Jersey City University in 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the many options available to me at the time I decided I wanted to
      venture into the local government sector and work at City Hall in Jersey
      City in the community health advocacy space. I realized that this role
      wasn't the best fit for me. During the height of C-19 I worked as a
      contractor for the New York Department of Labor as an unemployment
      insurance claims specialist for Navient. I enjoyed screening government ID
      docs for fraud and validating claims. My favorite part was starting off
      with a yelling customer and ending the call with them being a happy
      camper. Using the ancient virtual desktop environments was challenging,
      and I liked that too. The more fraudulent documents I came across, the
      more cyber crime stories interested me and I enrolled in a cybersecurity
      bootcamp program in Dallas, TX.
    </p>
    <p>
      While developing my skills I accepted a customer support role at my first
      SaaS company--FEVO. While at FEVO I responded to hundreds of support
      tickets per day in the salesforce environment and enjoyed virtually
      hearing from die hard fans spanning from NHL, NFL, NBA, tennis, golf, and
      e-gaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got the knack of explaining how to navigate webpages to customers via
      email and submitting bug tickets via JIRA. I'm passionate about customer
      support, customer success, and DevSecOps. I am currently working on the
      following certifications and coding languages: Javascript, SQL, C++,
      Python, HTML, Ruby, and Node.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my current company I made the leap from Customer Success Admin to QA
      Software Engineer in 9 months. Dottid is a SaaS platform that optimizes
      asset management for clients in the CRE space.
    </p>
    <p>
      My personality type is INFP-T and I'm deeply introverted, but friendly and
      more task-oriented in the workspace.
    </p>
