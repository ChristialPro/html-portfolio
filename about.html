<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Christial. Some people may have opinions about me but like hedge hogs,
  everyone has one... or is that how the saying goes? Haha. Once you get to know
  me I am an adventurous, gutsy entrepreuer who is inspired by Walker Texas
  Ranger. Ironically I had no concept of Texas until I moved here during la
  pandemia.

  I am now a certified Texan by way of Buckies gas station and slim cut peppered
  beef jerky. My hidden talents include playing the cello when I'm moody, making
  jokes that only I think are worth giggling about, and playing soccer tag, and
  pin the tail on the neighbor with my puppy Willie "William" Nelson.
